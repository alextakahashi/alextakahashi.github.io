<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am a software engineer with 5+ years of programming experience.  Primarily,
	my expertise is in iOS Engineer with 3+ years of experience exclusively in
	Swift.  Graduating from UC Berkeley in Spring 2017 with a B.S. in Bioengineering
	and a Minor in Computer Science, I now pursue my passion for software full time!</p>

	<p>I have a genuine curiosity to learn how things work.  In a way, I like to
		break things, and put them back together!  Experimentation plays a crucial
		role in how I approach my work and live my life.  I have a learn-by-doing attitude
		and always take a hands on approach to my work.  Read below for my work history and more!
