# 📝 Resume Content - Convince Me WHY You're the Right Candidate

> TL;DR - Your resume should be tailored to the job application.  Each and every bullet point should build your case why you're a prime candidate for the job role.

NOTE: This post is primarily applicable to upcoming University Grads recruiting for a technical role (Software Engineering), but the principles here should be relevant to any resume.

Addressing common questions / patterns in resumes to put your best foot forward when the recruiter dives into your experiences.

* How long should my resume be?  What experiences do I include?
* Should I put my GPA on my resume?
* How do I keep the recruiter's attention?

Previously, I detailed [Structuring Your Resume and Why It Matters](https://alextakahashi.github.io/Structuring-Your-Resume/) to make a strong first impression for recruitment.  The content of the resume should build a persuasive case why you're right for the job.  Jump straight to the point and hit the ground running with tips for each of the sections below.

1. Contact Information
2. Education
3. Skills
4. Professional Experience
5. Projects
6. Awards/Acknowledgements

## Contact Information

**Include your Personal Website, Github/Bitbucket, and LinkedIn**.  All these items show that you go above and beyond in your preparation for recruitment.

> Q. Do people actually look at these? 

A.  Yes, I would check to see if any of these are on included on a resume.  No, I would not necessarily visit these links.

Inclusion of these implies you have some knowledge of web + version control + online recruitment.  All good signs that you are in the know.

## Education

> Q. What is your education background?  Did you study in a technical field?  

For most of you, this will be your University + Major.  Recruiters are looking for someone who has a technical background, it is okay to have a non technical major / minor in the case that your work/project experience is strong.

Other educational background - include your Coding Bootcamp experience if applicable.  Avoid including High School information since your Higher Education background should be sufficient - use this space on your resume to include more experiences.

> Q. When are you graduating?

This determines how soon you are eligible for Full Time Work.  Recruiters want to convert interns to full time.

> Q. What courses were taken to support this person as a strong candidate?

Only include courses that speak to the role you're applying to.  Definitely include your techinal courses, *Data Structures + Algorithms*, *Linear Algebra*, *Discrete Math*, etc.  Do not include introduction courses + irrelevant courses (**Intro to Japanese**, **Intro to Python**).  Use generalized course names - not their number.  Recruiters will not know what CS170 is, explicitly mention as Efficient Algorithms.

> Q. Is GPA Mentioned on the resume?

GPA is not required especially for the technical field.  GPA is not necessarily a good indicator if someone will be successful for the job - your Work Experience + Professional Experience should make up for any GPA gaps.  Only include your GPA if its strong (3.0+).  

I kept my GPA off my resume - admittedly I did not do so hot in college grade wise!  My experiences made up for the gaps in my resume to push me through my recruitment.

* University Name
* Degree + Minors
* Graudation Date
* Relevant Coursework

---

The first impression of your resume **sets the bar for the recruitment process**.  Following a **predictable + impact forward** approach will help recruitment know quickly if you are a prime candidate for the role.

NOTE: This post is primarily geared toward university grads entering a technical field, but these principles can be applied to any resume.

## 🤔 Resume Sections + Ordering

Your resume needs the items below in the following order.  I will be diving deeper into each section later in this post. 

1. Contact Information
2. Education
3. Skills
4. Professional Experience
5. Projects
6. Awards/Acknowledgements

Advice on Resume Content coming up in a future post!

## 📱 Contact Information

> Q. Who is the candidate I am reading about?  Do I have a way of contacting them if there is a match?

Your name should be first and foremost on your resume.  Followed by your contact information so the recruiter can reach out via email or phone to chat more.  If this is not clearly in your face - it's on to the next resume in the pile.

* Name
* Phone Number
* Email

> Q. Can I find additional material to learn more about the candidate?

Your resume should speak for itself, but on the off chance recruitment needs additional information they can visit your online profiles.  Simply *having this on your profile* sets you apart from candidates who don't.  A website is already a project you can plug in before recruitment reads your Projects Section.  A Github account means you have some grasp of version control.  A LinkedIn is more in depth version of your resume - its 2020, please create one if you haven't already.

* Personal Website
* Github/Bitbucket
* LinkedIn

## 🎓 Education

> Q. What stage is this person in his career?  How recently was he in school?

The graduation date + degree automatically puts you in a bucket for certain roles: Internship? New University Grad? PhD Candidate?  Sanity check - if you're a new grad you probably do not fit the skill set for Staff Engineer / Director.

* University
* Degree + Expected Graduation Date
* Relevant Coursework

## Skills

> Q. Will his skill set fit the tech stack we use?

Drop in buzzwords that are relevant to the job role.  This section can sound like a laundry list because your experience detailed below will expand on the skills you mentioned.  If the skills do not speak to the role, this can turn into a quick pass on the resume.  For example, an iOS Engineer should be able to identify technologies needed to be successful: Swift, Objective-C, UIKit, Xcode, TestFlight.

* Programming Languages
* Frameworks
* Desktop Tools

## 💼 Professional Experience

NOTE: If you're just beginning your career it is okay to put more content in your Projects Section.  These two sections follow similar principles/guidelines.

> Q. What professional work has the candidate done?  How many years of experience? How does the work compliment the job role?

Companies in a similar field + products in a similar domain are good signals for a stronger candidate.  Without getting into the content of this section, at a baseline this section should plug what role you filled, what company, and how long you worked.  If the role proposes 8+ years of experience a resume showing < 1 year does not align with expectations.

* Job Title
* Company / Organization
* Location
* Employment Period

## 🧪 Projects

> Q. What projects has the candidate worked on that compliments the job role?

Again, similar story as professional experience.  Although this is not strongly tied to a company you can still highlight how you used your skills to push a working product.

* Project Name
* Short Blurb
* Execution Time Period

## 🏆 Awards/Acknolwedgements

> Q. How active is this person in the technical space?

If the read-through went this far, it's a good sign.  The remainder of the sections are to convince readers who are still on the fence.  Show that you are active in the community by listing anything notable that you've accomplished.

* Competition Wins
* Scholarships Received
* Hackathons Participated

## 🏎 Optional - Interests

> Q. How do I start a conversation with this person before we do a technical interview?

If you are struggling to fill space, you can put a small section of your hobbies and interests.  This is largely just for conversation starters when you chat with team members, but a filled resume is better than a lot of white space.

* Hobbies

# Conclusion + Next Steps

I hope reading this post makes you revisit your resume and question if your structure is easily digestable for recruitment to pass you through to the next stage. The structure is the first hurdle to jump through when the recruiter is skimming through your work, the next is your content — the make it or break it moment of your recruitment process. In my next post I will dive deeper into each of the sections about what content should be included and how to communicate your impact.
