# ✅ Career Fair Checklist - 5 Tips for Success 

I’ve been on both sides of the career fair booth by now and I would love to share some of my own tips to shine when you meet with a recruiter (in person/virtual).

* Do your recruiting homework
* Target Specific Companies
* Rehearse your pitch
* Demo your projects
* Followup!

Reviewing these 5 things should give you the confidence to stand out at your next career fair 

## 📚 Recruiting Homework

* Who is attending the career fair?
* What positions are open for my skill set? 
* Is my resume specifically tailored for that skill set? (Take notes)

## 🎯 Target Specific Companies

* Filter specific companies to your skill set
* Prioritize the companies to chat with (there may be long lines)
* Focus in on a specific role per company

## 🎤 Rehearse your pitch

* Introduce yourself short, sweet, and to the point.
* Identify your strongest projects and experience
* Practice with a friend out loud.

## 📲 Demo your projects 

* Show your app / website /  hackathon project (or some video recording) - Bonus points if you’ve integrated their service 
* Emphasize buzz words and metics that drove your project
* Highlight some interesting problems that you encountered and how you resolved them

## 🔄 Followup!

* Give thanks!
* Suggest connecting on LinkedIn / Email AND send a follow up message
* Always apply online

## ⭐️ Review Dialog

Practice the Dialog below:

> “Hi my name is NAME and I’m a X year student at UNIVERSITY studying MAJOR.  I heard you’re hiring for POSITION according to your website!”

*Recruiter Response*

> “I’d like to drop off my resume with you and I’d love to quickly demo one of my projects”

*Recruiter Response*

> “I had a question about (recruitment process, company culture, engineering stack)”

*Recruiter Response*

> “Thanks for taking the time to come out to chat today. I’d love to continue the conversation some time - would it be possible to connect with you on LinkedIn?”

*Recruiter Response*

> “Great.  Thank you for your time!”

## 💭 Closing Thoughts

* First impressions are key - the opening pitch sets the tone for the rest of your chat
* Convince the recruiter you’re a strong hire - don’t give us any reason to doubt it (do your homework)
* Confidence - Have faith that you’re qualified to tackle intern/full time work!  Show us you’re ready!

## 🏔 Call to Action

* Rehearse your pitch with a friend.  Share this post and invite someone to practice with you!
* Revise your resume.  Ask for a critique from a colleague / mentor / professional in the industry.
