# Team Selection: Finding Strong Teams

> TL;DR - Why strong teams are important + How to find strong teams

NOTE: This post is primarily geared toward Facebook Bootcamp Team Selection but can be applied to any team setting.

## 🙋‍♂️ Strong Teams are Foundation for Strong Products + Careers

In my opinion, more than any other factor to success is a strong team.  An effective team should enable the following:

* **Product Direction** - Prioritizing the most important metrics so that we solve critical path issues.
* **Distributed Responsibilities** - Definitive ownership so contributors can focus and avoid context-switching.
* **Growth + Scale** - Opportunities to continue learning and level up your technical / product knowledge.

Outcomes from a strong team include:¡
* **Reaching Team Goals** - Commitments to metric goals are aggressive yet attainable.  Meeting expecations are baseline for success.
* **Career Progression** - Mentorship from your teammates pave a path forward for your growth.
* **Sustainable Work Life Balance** - Contributors stay because they can juggle work and avoid compromising external responsibilities.

## 💪 Signals of Strong Teams

Look for the following during team selection:

* **Consistent Track Record** - Teams meet their goals they committed to half over half.
* **Healthy Pulse Surveys** - Anonymous surveys mention work sentiment.
* **Tenured Contributors** - Turnover is low + teammembers want to stay.

# How to Find Strong Teams

## 🔍 Doing Your Research
* **Comms** - What type of content are team members posting? Are they active in communities / forums?
* **Diffs / Commits** - What type of code are team members committing?  Evalute the code + meta critically - is the code polished?  Is the Summary + Test Plan thorough? How are team members communicating though code?  Inline comments?

## ❓ Questions to ask the Hiring Managers
* What are the goals of your team?
* What does the day to day look like?  (Running A/B Tests? Working on new features?)
* What meetings take place + what are they for?
* What are your expectations for my career growth?
* Who should I talk to next? (Possibly the Tech Lead, Project Manager, Senior Engineers, etc.)

# Conclusion + Next Steps

I hope reading this post provides more clarity about finding your next team.  I encourage you to be curious and ask lots of questions - this will be the team you will be spending your working days with so it is best to do your homework and find your best match!
